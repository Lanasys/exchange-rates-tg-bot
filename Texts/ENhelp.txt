This bot recognizes numbers and currencies in the text and then automatically sends a message converting the amount to other currencies.

If you want to know about the authors, version, source code, and/or license, use the /about command.

If you want to change the output currencies or the rights to delete messages, use the /settings command.

If you notice an error in the bot's text recognition, please reply to the original message with the /wrong command.

If you notice any other problems, please write to one of the creators in a private message.
